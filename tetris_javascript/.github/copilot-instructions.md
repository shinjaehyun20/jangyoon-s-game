<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->
- [ ] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [ ] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided. -->

- [ ] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	Ensure that the previous step has been marked as completed.
	Call project setup tool with projectType parameter.
	Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
	Use '.' as the working directory.
	If no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.
	Otherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.
	-->

- [ ] Customize the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.
	Develop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
	Apply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
	Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.
	-->

- [ ] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- ONLY install extensions provided mentioned in the get_project_setup_info. Skip this step otherwise and mark as completed. -->

- [ ] Compile the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Install any missing dependencies.
	Run diagnostics and resolve any issues.
	Check for markdown files in project folder for relevant instructions on how to do this.
	-->

- [ ] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.
	 -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.
	 -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.
	Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
